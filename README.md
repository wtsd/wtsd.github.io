# Repository Guide

This page is kind of a map of my work, experiments, and reusable building blocks. Also, it might contain some docs-only repos.
It is designed for:

* myself in 6–12 months
* teammates and reviewers
* interview prep and knowledge sharing
* indulging in laziness and not creating a standalone website

Use it as a high-level index. Each repository should have its own README with details.

## How to Navigate

* **Core** -- things I maintain and rely on
* **Learning** -- labs, experiments, notes, Coursera, and LinkedIn-learning stuff
* **Templates** -- copy-paste starters
* **Utilities** -- small tools and scripts
* **Archived** -- old but potentially useful ideas or outdated code (might be private)
* **Documentation** -- no code, just text that resides in GitHub
